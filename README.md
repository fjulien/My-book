## Me

Full Stack web developer for more one year, I work in team on website creation projects. I also carry out personal projects or projects of friends to put into practice my new knowledge. I am detail-oriented and always involved in my work. Curious and confirmed self-taught, I like to learn and use new skills in all areas, I get involved in the whole process of realizing a project. 

Amateur of sports, I practice running, indoor climbing and this year start rock dance classes.
